The purpose of this project is to develop a deep learning classifier to distinguish between pictures of three models of classic car:
* Renault 4 GTL
* Citroen 2CV
* Volkswagen Beetle


### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling
* etc.

### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas, Jupyter
* fastai
* Heroku
 
## Project Description
The pictures were scraped from Google Images and labeled by hand. The data consists of around 700 images for each model of car, and I've labeled around 50 pictures for each model of car. 
(Provide more detailed overview of the project.  Talk a bit about your data sources and what questions and hypothesis you are exploring. What specific data analysis/visualization and modelling work are you using to solve the problem? What blockers and challenges are you facing?  Feel free to number or bullet point things here)

## Needs of this project

- fixing the web app (it's currently broken)
- add a fourth class, "other", which includes random cars not corresponding any of these models.
